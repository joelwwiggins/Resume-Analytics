Cosine variance text analytics
The code is used as an alternative to the word count text comparison.  If one text is longer than the other then a word count analysis may give you skewed results.  This method allows you to standardize multiple length text into a vector.  Once we have a vector then we calulate the cosine of the vectors in space.  Idealy we want a cosine to approach 1.
