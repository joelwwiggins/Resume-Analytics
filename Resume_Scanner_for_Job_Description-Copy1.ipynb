Chemical Engineering (2004)\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nExperience\\n\\nLimetree Bay Refining\\n\\nCommercial Trading Linear Programming Analyst, Houston, TX (7/20-Present)\\n\\n\\n\\nAssigned to the Commercial Trading Group. Provided options to the traders for forecasted price and utilization impacts to the process optimization and profitability of the refinery. The analysis included crude and product pricing, amount and refinery configuration with utilization targets. \\n\\nI was able to identify issues and improve the accuracy of gasoline blending by improving the distillation, T50 and vapor to liquid ratio calculations.  This allowed more profitable grades to be produced worth $50,000/day with no capital cost.  From there I set out to build relationships with the local refinery team to implement the scheduling and planning and we got alignment to implement. \\n\\nResid and atmospheric column resid production was improved by editing the LP to match the refinery operator capability for atmospheric resid production and allowing better control of light cutter for blending. This change had an add on effect of improving product pricing and refinery process optimization by $40,000/day. \\n\\nTo analyze the pricing, I created python scripts to create a reusable data pipeline that organized data files from outlook or specific folders wangled the data together into dataframes and structured the information into similar groups with machine learning. I was then able to show that historical pricing was not correlated with crude market pricing and improved pricing by $0.50/bbl on 5 target crude groups. This same python pipeline was used to automate crude composition imports to the LP from a PDF. \\n\\nProcess Optimization model was moved to an online server. This provided a strategic direction to communicate results but also allow create larger data pipeline for feed purchase and sales direction. This also allows for a long term business strategy of importing all data to vendors to help with futures machine learning or AI projects.\\n\\nPricing and option data like volatility was used to develop a model that shows the current expected market movement and provide optimization target ranges and reduced risk to the refinery margin when not operating at the current conditions. I was able to show a broader optimization across scenarios when led to specific crudes and products to the bought and sold. This is one of the enjoyable part of the job that tied in with my own portfolio risk work that I do as a hobby.  Data from this analysis was also used by our own risk group at the refinery for budget risk assessments.\\n\\n\\n\\nMotiva\\n\\nProcess Engineering Team Lead, Port Arthur, TX (10/14-7/20.)\\n\\n\\n\\nAssigned to refinery process engineering yield, energy and hydrocarbon loss control group. Reviewed yield performance gaps on unit basis and refinery fence line balances. Set the vision to automate task that are difficult to retain knowledge on. Developed daily refinery material balance from meter and financial receipts. Developed kinetic models and aligned with actual data and kinetic models for delayed coking, reforming and crude models. Improved coker margin by $75MM/yr by adjusted feedstock strategy. Reformer blending rules updated along with finding meter corrections to match reformate and octane performance curve. Implemented training and process modeling procedures for maintaining and improving kinetic process models. Developed process to align planning model assay files with kinetic model results and actual data.  Once kinetic models and LP submodels were built I worked to put together Projects to automate the running of the kinetic models to compare against actual and LP submodel results. To sustain the model at the current pace training for kinetic models was increased to the current process engineering group.  I also worked with some universities to develop projects to help with the kinetic modeling efforts to steer future development and resources.  \\n\\nCrude unit performance to Planning assurance process- Developed hysys model of actual crude unit and swing cut planning model. Was able to verify performance over time and automate the process for producing crude planning files that met actual unit performance. ~$100MM\\n\\nDelayed Coker Kinetic Model to LP submodel development- Developed operational kinetic model and validated results against plant data.  Developed LP submodel update process to match model to plant data. $75MM\\n\\nCatalytic Reforming Kinetic model and LP submodel development- Developed operational kinetic model and validated results against plant data.  Developed LP submodel update process to match model to plant data. $25MM\\n\\nLed project to develop fence line balance with custody meter measurements and official financial receipts. Identified ~2MM/yr in potential imbalances.\\n\\nIdentified gasoline blending give away issues resulting in $30 MM/yr savings \\n\\n\\n\\nValero\\n\\nCrude and Feedstock Coordinator, Port Arthur, TX (11/07 to 10/14.)\\n\\n\\n\\nAssigned to refinery process engineering group.  Responsibilities included unit monitoring, unit modeling and troubleshooting issues to some resolution.  The product of performance monitoring was followed up with both short and long range process improvements along with the cost and benefit of partial applications.  Provided technical support for various safety and hazard recognition meetings. Developed catalyst change engineering requirement packages pre-turnaround with follow post turnaround report and recommendations. Planning experience consisted of schedule development as well as monitoring refinery balances and unit operations so that the refinery met multiple limits of rates and yields. Specific process background includes gasoline reforming (CCR and multistage), FCC, gasoil hydrotreating, Decoking, Crude distillation.\\n\\n\\n\\nDeveloped basis for Valero unit modeling and automated reconciliation to drive decision making on unit performance and accuracy of the LP.  Models were updated with material balance data and operational data.  The results were also easily compared to actual data to improve model predictions as well as LP curves of the units. Models of the coker, FCC, gasoil hydrotreater and crude unit were developed.  In particular the FCC model was able to increase rate by 10 Mbpd and improve volume gain. Methods used to develop the model and reconciliation were implemented at multiple Valero sites. ($30,000/day)\\n\\n\\n\\nImplemented similar actual vs. predicted rate comparison in the crude and feedstocks position.  Exceeded previous refinery max crude rates by 15 Mbpd on a monthly average by adjusting crude mix to hit multiple refinery limits.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommended and implemented changes to amine tower regenerator and contactor on the FCC. The changes maximized feed sulfur during the gasoil hydrotreater end of run conditions with higher product sulfur and allowed more produced feed to be ran.\\n\\n\\n\\nBP \\n\\nOperations Engineer, Texas City, TX (5/01 to 11/07)\\n\\n\\n\\nAssigned to fuels refinery/chemicals plant site.
